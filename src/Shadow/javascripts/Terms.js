              as to diminish chances of damage as much as possible. You are to
              make sure that the items are properly packed to avoid injury or
              accident transportation.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are to encourage bubble-wrap of any electronics you to receive
              form Clients, so as to avoid damaging the item.
            </p>
            <p>
              All payment are made by Client via the PickLoad App payment
              method, however you are not requested to collect any money from
              the Client. You are to report any damaged/missing/lost items to
              our support team within 5 hours of dispatch. PickLoad would not
              take liability of any item that is damaged or lost.
            </p>
            <h3>LIABILITY</h3>
            <p>
              YOUR ATTENTION IS DRAWN PARTICULARLY TO THIS CLAUSE AND THE LIMITS
              OF OUR LIABILITY WITHIN IT. As a responsible business, PickLoad
              and the respective Riders/Freelancers shall hopefully perform the
              Service(s) in a professional manner with the appropriate level of
              skill and care. PickLoad will not take liability of any item that
              is damaged or lost. Damage to a Consignment may still occur as a
              consequence of handling of it and in such circumstances, PickLoad
              liability shall be limited as set out in this Terms and
              Conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The reasoning behind this limitation of our liability is as
              follows: The value of a Consignment and the amount of potential
              loss to you that could arise if a Consignment is damaged or lost
              is not something which can be easily ascertained but is something
              which is better known to the Client.
            </p>
            <p>
              In many cases it cannot be known to PickLoad at all and can only
              be known to the Client. The potential amount of loss that might be
              caused or alleged to be caused to you is likely to be
              disproportionate to the sum that could reasonably be expected to
              charge you for providing the Service(s) under this Agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is not possible to obtain cover which would give unlimited
              compensation for full potential liability to all customers and,
              even if it were, such cover would be much cheaper if taken out by
              you and on that basis, it is more reasonable for you to take out
              such cover from an independent third party. It is imperative to
              keep the costs of providing the Service(s) to you as low as
              possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this Terms and Conditions, damage to you means any loss of, or
              damage to, a Consignment.
            </p>
            <p>
              PICKLOAD shall not be liable to you under any circumstances where
              there are any material discrepancies between the declared
              dimensions and weights and the actual dimensions and weights;
            </p>
            <h3>Payment</h3>
            <p>
              Payment shall be made every Sunday of the week for all deliveries
              carried out in previous week ( Payment of Deliveries from Sunday
              to Saturday). All payment shall be made via your bank account.
            </p>
            <p>
              Selecting a particular payment method for the weekly remittance
              means you are agreeing to the terms of service of the Company's
              processing partners and your financial institution. You will bear
              all fees that may be charged by such processing partners and/or
              your financial institution (if any) for the payment method you
              have selected.
            </p>
            <h3>Taxes</h3>
            <p>
              You agree that this Agreement shall be subject to all prevailing
              statutory taxes, duties, fees, charges and/or costs, however
              denominated, as may be in force in Nigeria and in connection with
              any future taxes that may be introduced at any point of time. You
              further agree to use your best efforts to do everything necessary
              and required by the relevant laws to enable, assist and/or defend
              the Company to claim or verify any input tax credit, set off,
              rebate or refund in respect of any taxes paid or payable in
              connection with the Service supplied under this Agreement.
